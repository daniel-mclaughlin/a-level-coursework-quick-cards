# a-level-coursework-quick-cards
This is my first ever large coding project, I worked on it as part of my A-level computer science coursework. The link to the development log can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ElXS-qESd9GaZMQ0LvgqJQ2miLnIgWVxmXgKMjk3JDg/edit?usp=sharing)
The app includes:
- Login/signup system
- Flashcard editor
- Spaced repition algorithm, reccomends cards to the users at the optimal time for retention
- Ability to add friends and view their recent activities
- A daily streak system that can be triggered through experience points or cards studied
I learnt alot about web development, specifically full stack JavaScript and handling large projects and I'am very proud of it.
